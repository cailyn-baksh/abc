				This project is a compiler system similar to LLVM, designed with
				esoteric languages in mind. The system includes a set of
				"front-ends" for several languages, and “back-ends” for several
				architectures. It also includes a standard intermediate
				representation (IR) virtual machine which allows the front ends and
				back ends to work in tandem without needing to be designed with the
				other specifically in mind. The general process of compiling is as
				follows:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					A compiler front-end (language) and back-end (architecture) are
					selected.
				</li>
				<li>
					The front-end performs first-stage compilation to IR
					<ol>
						<li>
							The source file is tokenized by the front-end parser.
						</li>
						<li>
							The front-end performs first-pass optimization on the
							tokens.
						</li>
						<li>
							The first-stage compiler compiles the optimized tokens
							into IR.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					The optimizer optimizes the IR code in the primary optimization
					phase.
				</li>
				<li>
					The back-end compiler assembles IR code into machine code
					<ol>
						<li>
							Each IR instruction is replaced with its machine code
							equivalent.
						</li>
						<li>
							The back-end performs peephole optimization.
						</li>
						<li>
							The resulting machine code is placed into an object
							file.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
